I implemented my own version of a Heap to utilize as a priority queue (works by visualizing any d-ary tree). I then incorporated
this MinHeap class into a program performing A* search (heuristic-based graph search) to transform word A to word B by changing one 
letter at a time (each transformation must also be a valid word) given a text file of valid of intermediary words.
